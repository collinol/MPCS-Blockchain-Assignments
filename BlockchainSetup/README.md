# BlockChain
run  
$ python main.py   
to see the read out summary of the block chain. It also contains the 
creation of the genesis block and blocks 1 and 2, as well as the default
transactions (with one input and output each)  
There are additional functions in block chain like latest_block() and 
size_of_chain(), but weren't called in the main.py  
Also, "my.transaction.out" is in the same directory here but is for part one of the lab
